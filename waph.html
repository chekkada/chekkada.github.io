           This course focuses on the most important components of web application development, including front-end technologies like HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, as well as back-end technologies like PHP and MySQL. Participants will receive hands-on experience detecting and mitigating web application vulnerabilities and potential security risks. The program focuses on secure programming concepts to reduce risks and improve the resilience of web applications. To date, participants have completed Lab-0, Lab-1, Lab-2, Hackathon-1, and Individual Project-1, obtaining important practical experience in various aspects of web development and security.

        <!-- Lab-0 Overview -->
        <h2>Lab-0 Overview</h2>
        <p> 
        In the first phase of Lab 0 of the Web Application Programming and Hacking course, I successfully laid the groundwork for my development setup. This required the creation of an Ubuntu 22.04 virtual computer utilizing the UC Sandbox. To improve the environment, I installed essential applications such as Apache2, Git, Sublime Text, Pandoc, and the Chrome browser. Furthermore, I set up a private git repository on GitHub and shared it with the instructor, Dr. Phu Phung. The next steps were to clone the local repository, change the README.md file, and complete the Lab 0 exercises exactly as instructed. The entire process was thoroughly documented in Markdown, and I used the Pandoc tool to transform the manuscript to a submission-ready PDF file.

        <!-- Lab-1 Overview -->
        <h2>Lab-1 Overview</h2>
        <p>
        The lab was divided into two stages, with the first focusing on understanding the workings of the Web and HTTP Protocol, followed by hands-on practice with Basic Web Application Programming. During the initial step, I used the Wireshark tool to record and analyze the communication between my system and a web server. I meticulously documented the entire process, including HTTP Request, Response messages, and the HTTP Stream, to ensure a thorough understanding of the protocol's complexities. The second phase involves developing CGI web applications in C as well as a simple PHP web application to demonstrate my abilities to code, compile, and publish programs on the web server.

        <!-- Lab-2 Overview -->
        <h2>Lab-2 Overview</h2>
        <p>
       The lab consists of two assignments. In the first session, I created a basic HTML page using JavaScript and forms. I created a webpage called waph-yourusername.html that contains HTML elements such as an image, a form, and dynamic JavaScript features such as date/time display and keypress recording. The second assignment involved using Ajax for user input, providing dynamic responses, applying CSS styling, integrating jQuery for Ajax requests, and interacting with Web APIs to retrieve programming jokes and estimate age based on user input. This lab experience exposed students to different areas of web development, including HTML, JavaScript, Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and API integration.
        </p>
       

        <!-- Hackathon-1 Overview -->
        <h2>Hackathon-1 Overview</h2>
        <p>
        The XSS Hackathon, which focuses on Cross-site Scripting, is an educational endeavor aiming at delving into and understanding the various levels of XSS vulnerabilities in online applications. XSS, a common security flaw, allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages that are visible to other users. The hackathon has two main objectives: Task 1 focuses on identifying and exploiting XSS vulnerabilities within a specific online application, whereas Task 2 focuses on implementing preventive measures against XSS assaults to reduce the possibility of exploitation.

        <!-- Individual Project-1 Overview -->
        <h2>Individual Project-1 Overview</h2>
        <p>
      The project comprises creating a portfolio to showcase my skills and attract the attention of potential employers. The portfolio is currently available through a public repository. Along with adding information from my résumé, I successfully completed extra assignments set by my professor, several of which were covered in prior laboratory exercises.
